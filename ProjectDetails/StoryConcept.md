The inclusion of **Shamans** and **Skinwalkers** transforms the "Par" mechanic from a simple timer into a battle of wills. You aren't just overstaying your welcome; you are being actively hunted by the immune system of the planet.

Here is how we integrate the Shaman/Skinwalker mechanic into the gameplay loop and aesthetic.

### 1. The Narrative Mechanic: "The Biome's Immune System"

In this world, the **Shamans** are not people; they are manifestations of the biome itself. They are the "white blood cells" trying to purge your caravan (the infection).

* **The Shaman (The Puppeteer):** You rarely see them directly. They are a presence in the fog, a chanting sound in the audio mix, or a shadow on a ridge. They cast "Rituals" that buff the wildlife.
* **The Skinwalker (The Avatar):** If you stay too long, the Shaman constructs a physical body—a grotesque amalgamation of bone, wood, and fur—that actively hunts you.

### 2. The Escalation Phases (The "Par" System)

Let’s visualize how the environment turns against you day by day.

**Phase 1: The Dormant Wilds (Under Par)**

* **Atmosphere:** Quiet. The pixel art uses cool blues and greys.
* **Wildlife:** Neutral. Animals flee if you approach.
* **The Shaman:** Absent.
* **Gameplay:** Standard resource gathering.

**Phase 2: The Waking Eye (Approaching Par)**

* **Atmosphere:** Unsettling. The wind sound effects get louder. You see totems (sticks and bones) appearing near your resource nodes.
* **Wildlife:** Aggressive. Wolves stop fleeing and start circling.
* **The Shaman:** You hear chanting at night.
* **Gameplay:** Small skirmishes. You must destroy totems to lower the threat level.

**Phase 3: The Blood Moon (Over Par - High Risk)**

* **Atmosphere:** Hostile. The lighting shifts to the **Deep Reds** seen in your second image. Rain turns to blood or ash.
* **The "Skinwalker" Effect:**
* **Possession:** The animals you are trying to tame have glowing red eyes. If you tame them, they have a % chance to frenzy and attack *your* units.
* **Mutated Fauna:** Animals spawn with "Bone Armor" or extra limbs, making them harder to kill but dropping rarer loot.



**Phase 4: The Environmental Rejection (Critical Overstay)**

* **The Land Fights Back:** This is the key feature you mentioned.
* **Root Traps:** Trees animate and try to strangle your units, rooting them in place.
* **Terrain Shift:** The path you took yesterday is now blocked by a wall of thorns. The map geometry literally changes to box you in.
* **Resource Rot:** If you don't harvest resources quickly, they "rot" and turn into traps.



### 3. Gameplay Mechanics: Fighting the Influence

Since this is a Tower Defense/Caravan game, the Shaman mechanics need to mess with your defensive setup.

**The "Corruption" Stat**
Your caravan has a "Mental Sanity" or "Corruption" meter.

* As the Shaman exerts influence, your tamed animals (your towers) begin to glitch.
* **Mechanic:** You might place a "War Bear" to defend your flank. If the Shaman is powerful in that area, the War Bear might ignore orders, fall asleep, or turn around and attack your wagon.
* **Counter-Play:** You must craft "Wards" (using Moonstone) to create safe zones where your animals remain loyal.

**The Skinwalker Boss (The Ambush)**
If you stay for the "Bonus" (e.g., the War Bird migration), the Shaman manifests as a Skinwalker boss.

* **Visual:** A towering, lanky pixel-art figure wearing the skull of a stag (reminiscent of your first image), floating slightly off the ground.
* **Ability - "Mimicry":** The Skinwalker can shape-shift into one of *your* units. You have to figure out which "Archer" is actually the boss before it assassinates your leader.

### 4. UI Implications

The UI needs to reflect this growing hostility.

* **The Compass:** Instead of North/South, the needle spins erratically when a Shaman is watching you.
* **The Screen Edge:** As you stay past the "Par," the edges of the screen start to accumulate a "vignette" of creeping dark roots or red static, effectively shrinking your field of view.

### A New Unit Concept: "The Purified"

To counter the Skinwalkers, you can find rare "Purified" animals.

* **Visual:** Instead of the red/black corruption, these animals glow with the cyan/white light seen in your first image (the antlers).
* **Function:** They are immune to Shaman possession. They act as "Mobile Wards," protecting nearby units from being turned against you.
